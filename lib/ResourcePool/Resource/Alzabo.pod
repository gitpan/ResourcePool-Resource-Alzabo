=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use ResourcePool::Resource::Alzabo;

 my $resource =  ResourcePool::Resource::Alzabo->new(
                        $schema_name,
                        $data_source,
                        $username,

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is used by the L<ResourcePool|ResourcePool> internally to 
load the L<Alzabo::Runtime::Schema|Alzabo::Runtime::Schema> object and 
associate it with L<DBI|DBI> connections. Its called by the corresponding
L<ResourcePool::Factory::Alzabo|ResourcePool::Factory::Alzabo> object 
which passes the parameters needed to load the schema and establish 
the L<DBI|DBI> connection.

The connection management is inherited from L<ResourcePool::Resource::DBI|ResourcePool::Resource::DBI>.
